Important note, the assumption is that there is only one config per website, so I can use the name of the sites in config as a key in a dictionary

The challenge states that the bidder must be known, but also that there shouldn't be any faulty data, so I just want to state that I haven't done any error checking for if the bidder exists or not, I assume just checking whether the bidder is one of the permitted bidders on the site is enough.

In case of tie after adjustment, bidder who made bid first will win the unit. (First bidder in the json file)
